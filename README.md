### Getting Started

#### Technical Spike
We started by initiating a technical spike to see what APIs were available for us to obtain geographical information. The API was extremely important to get our app working as this information was vital to the project.

#### Google-locations npm & Google Places API 
The Google-locations package allows users to use the basic functions of Google Places such as search, autocomplete, and details. The package also provides geocoding and reverse geocoding capabilities with the Google Geocoding API.
